## Product Requirements Document (Final)

### Summary

Innovation requires more than technical skill—it demands character. Yet most professionals lack systematic approaches to develop the virtues that fuel breakthrough thinking: courage to challenge assumptions, humility to learn from failure, wisdom to navigate complexity, and empathy to understand user needs. Current productivity tools optimize for efficiency but ignore the character development that drives meaningful innovation.

We're building an agentic AI system that bridges this gap by helping users identify, develop, and apply character traits to drive innovation. The system will assess users' character profiles, provide personalized virtue-based coaching with philosophical wisdom, and analyze their daily work patterns to identify opportunities for character-driven growth and innovation.

This isn't just another productivity app—it's a character formation platform that recognizes virtue as the foundation of both personal excellence and breakthrough innovation, operationalizing proven character development strategies through intelligent automation.

### MVP Scope

Must-Have Features for Launch:

*   **Comprehensive Character Assessment using R.I.G.H.T. Framework (10 core virtues):**
    *   A multi-layered process combining quantitative (psychometric-style questionnaire with 40-60 behavioral statements on a Likert scale), qualitative (3-5 scenario-based micro-dilemmas), and personalized (open-ended self-reflection prompts) elements.
    *   Output includes normalized virtue scores (0-100) for each of the 10 virtues, a radar chart visualizing strengths and growth areas, a narrative virtue profile, initial behavioral commitments, identified risk patterns and innovation blind spots, and a first-week coaching plan.
*   **Personal Character Goal Setting:** Users, guided by the initial assessment, will select 2-3 priority virtues to develop and connect them to their innovation goals. The system will provide initial behavioral commitments and a first-week coaching plan based on these selections.
*   **Personalized Virtue-Based Coaching (Initial Forms):**
    *   Daily philosophical quote delivery with reflection prompts relevant to target virtues.
    *   Immediate, personalized feedback and reflective prompts after logging character moments.
*   **Daily Character Moment Logging:** Users can log quick character moments (successes, challenges, insights) throughout their day via voice or text. The AI will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and voice sentiment analysis to categorize these moments by virtue and context, providing immediate feedback and follow-up questions.
*   **Calendar Integration for Time and Pattern Analysis:** Basic integration to analyze how users spend their time, identifying patterns that support or hinder character goals, and flagging opportunities for character-driven growth and innovation.
*   **Weekly Character Reflection and Progress Tracking:**
    *   Delivery of a personalized weekly audio clip summarizing the week's character progress, highlighting character moments, areas for improvement, insights from daily work patterns, philosophical wisdom, and motivational encouragement.
    *   The audio clip will also outline the focus and specific challenges for the coming week.
*   **Simple News Article Search:** Functionality to find and present news articles about individuals demonstrating character, relevant to the user's target virtues.
*   **Basic User Dashboard:** Visual display of character growth trends over time, including radar charts, virtue scores, and progress against behavioral commitments.

Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP):

*   Email sentiment and communication pattern analysis
*   Peer accountability feedback or rating
*   Advanced insights from calendar/email
*   Customizable virtue frameworks beyond R.I.G.H.T.
*   Integration with workplace tools (Slack, Teams)
*   Interactive exercises (e.g., role-playing scenarios, video/audio recordings for practice)
*   Weekly or monthly challenges to actively practice target virtues
*   Mentorship or peer feedback options for character moments

### User Stories / Workflows

**Onboarding & Assessment:**

*   **As a user, I can complete a comprehensive character assessment to understand my current virtue profile.**
    *   I will complete a **quantitative assessment** by answering 40-60 psychometric-style behavioral statements on a Likert scale (1-5) for each of the 10 R.I.G.H.T. virtues.
    *   I will engage in a **qualitative assessment** by responding to 3-5 scenario-based micro-dilemmas that require virtue-driven decision-making in real-world work contexts.
    *   I will complete a **personalization layer** through open-ended self-reflection prompts to contextualize my virtues within my work environment.
    *   Upon completion, I will receive a **normalized score (0-100)** for each virtue, a **radar chart** visualizing my strengths and growth areas, a **narrative virtue profile** summarizing my assessment, and identified **risk patterns and innovation blind spots**.
*   **As a user, I can select 2-3 character traits I want to develop and connect them to my innovation goals.** The system will provide initial behavioral commitments and a first-week coaching plan based on my assessment results and chosen priorities.
*   **As a user, I can set up calendar integration to enable analysis of how I spend my time** and identify opportunities for character-driven growth.

**Engagement:**

*   **As a user, I receive a philosophical quote with a reflection question relevant to my target virtues daily.**
*   **As a user, I can log quick character moments (successes, challenges, insights) throughout my day via voice or text.**
    *   The AI will use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **voice sentiment analysis** to understand my input, categorize it by virtue (e.g., courage, empathy, humility), and tag it with contextual information (e.g., meeting, project, conflict).
    *   I will receive **immediate, personalized feedback** and **reflective prompts** (e.g., "Great job showing courage in that decision! How did you feel after you made it?") to deepen my self-awareness and guide my growth.
    *   The system will track these moments to identify patterns, provide trend visualizations, and suggest actionable strategies for improvement (e.g., "You've logged several moments where you felt unsure in meetings. Try writing down key points before each meeting.").
*   **As a user, I can receive recent articles where people demonstrate character** relevant to my development goals.

**Weekly Reflection:**

*   **As a user, I receive a personalized weekly audio clip that reflects on my past week.** This audio clip will include:
    *   A **summary of my character progress**, highlighting how I demonstrated target virtues and specific character moments.
    *   **Insights into missed opportunities** and constructive feedback for areas needing improvement, with suggestions for the next week.
    *   **Insights from my daily work patterns**, explaining how my calendar or actions aligned with my character goals (e.g., "You spent a lot of time on urgent tasks, making reflection difficult. Schedule intentional breaks next week.").
    *   **Philosophical wisdom and encouragement**, including relevant quotes and motivational words.
    *   A summary of my **visual progress and milestone recognition**.
    *   A clear **focus for the coming week**, recommending specific virtues to practice and offering a small challenge or exercise.
    *   **Personalized reminders and actionable next steps** to continue my character development journey.
*   **As a user, I can see patterns in my calendar that either support or hinder my character goals, presented as opportunities for growth.**
    *   For example, the system might notify me: "You had an opportunity today to challenge a decision in the meeting but chose not to speak up. Next time, consider how you can voice your thoughts with courage."
    *   It could also highlight: "During your meeting today, there were moments when you seemed focused on your agenda rather than understanding others’ concerns. Next time, try asking one clarifying question to better understand their perspective to build empathy."
    *   I will receive actionable suggestions and visual reports to help me understand and act on these opportunities.
*   **As a user, I receive a suggestion for practicing a specific virtue in the coming week**, often delivered within the personalized weekly audio clip.

**Progress Tracking:**

*   **As a user, I can visualize my character development progress over time** through radar charts, virtue scores, and graphs showing trends in specific virtues, based on my assessments and logged character moments.
